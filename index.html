    <p> The goal of this exercise is to understand and examine how eveyday users interact with a public interface in
        order to
        gain insight into the UX design process and learn how to better construct similar interfaces.</p>

        <p>The public interface I chose to examine was a self-checkout kiosk located at CVS. I first analyzed all the
            different aspects of the interface, then observed and interviewed a few users about the process of using the
            interface. Then, I constructed personas based off those user experiences and finally created a storyboard
            to visually show the whole process of using that interface.</p>

<div id="interface" class="container-fluid">
    <h4> Interface </h4>
    <p class="text-dark"> An interface is chosen. All interactive elements of the system are examined and noted.
        <br>Focus is given to the purpose and use of the interface; what problem it is trying to solve.
    </p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <h5>Physical Interface</h5>
        <img class="ishot" src="Photos/InterfaceP.png">
        <p>This interface has both a physical and digital component. Along with the digital terminal, the kiosk also
            includes an area to scan items and a payment terminal on the right. The purpose of this interface is to
            automate the process of customer checkout. The interface is designed to be easy to understand on the first
            use and quick to complete.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Digital Interface</h5>
        <img class="dshot" src="Photos/InterfaceF.png">
        <p>Below is represented the important screens of the digital interface. It takes you through the process of
            paying for items.</p>

<div id="observations" class="bg-dark">
    <h4 class="text-light text-center">Observations</h4>
    <p class="text-light text-center"> Real world users are observed using the interface. Then, they are interviewed
        based on thier
        experineces.
        <br>Emphasis is put on objective observations and the user's goals and difficulties while using the interface.

                        of outside assistance
                        <br> - Most of the users took a similar amount of time (around 2 min 35 sec) to finish using the
                        interface
                        <br> - The help button on the interface seemed to do nothing when one of the users pressed it,
                        and the user had to physically go and ask a worker for help
                        <br> - All users were immediately able to understand how to use the interfaces' scanner.

                        <li>2. Are there any features of a checkout with a store clerk that you would want the
                            self-service kiosk to include?</li>

            in understanding how to use the physical aspects of the interface</li>
        <li class="text-light">One of the users had coupons and was frustrated by the fact that when coupons are
            submitted, the reduction
            in cost is not calculated immediately but only when the user presses the pay button.</li>
        <li class="text-light">All the users felt the process of using the interface was very quick.</li>
        <li class="text-light">Another user voiced concern over the fact that the interface did not have a search bar,
            if
            the barcode does
            not work then there is no way to enter the item into the system.</li>
